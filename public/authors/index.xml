&lt;p&gt;Garbh-ini (Interdisciplinary Group for Advanced Research on Birth Outcomes—DBT India Initiative) was initiated by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), in 2014 as a collaborative interdisciplinary program. This program is led by Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), NCR Biotech cluster, Faridabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garbh-Ini is a cohort study of pregnant women initiated in May 2015 at the civil hospital in Gurugram, Haryana, India. Women are enrolled within 20 weeks of gestation and are followed until delivery and once postpartum. The objectives are to identify clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and microbial correlates; discover molecular-risk markers by using an integrative -omics approach; and generate a risk-prediction algorithm for preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof. Shinjini Bhatnagar is a physician scientist who worked with the Dept. of pediatrics at AIIMS for 25 years as a pediatric gastroenterologist and as a research scientist. Her group’s hypothesis driven research led to the introduction of the modified low osmolarity ORS and zinc in treatment of childhood Diarrhea and a diagnostic test for Celiac disease. She is currently the Dean for Clinical Research at the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, an autonomous institute of the Dept. of Biotechnology GOI.  She now leads large interdisciplinary research studies that bridge classical clinical research and modern biology to find solutions for diseases with public health importance. The two important programmes that she is coordinating are Garbh- ini (an interdisciplinary group for advanced research on birth outcome- DBT India initiative) and evaluation of Zinc as an adjunct to antimicrobial therapy for young infant sepsis. She is a fellow of three national academies i.e FAMS, NAMS and INSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research&#34;&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She moved to the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), NCR Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad in 2010 and established the Pediatric Biology Centre (PBC), an interdisciplinary research center for conducting research on maternal and child health to inform clinical practice. She initiated a novel research program to create new insights in the neonatal and infant immune systems, its maturation over infancy, and how it responds to antenatal, perinatal and early childhood stressors (PlosONE 2015). She established a unique large multidisciplinary research programs that bridge classical epidemiology with modern science to find solutions for diseases that have major public health significance in the country. The current focus is preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. The priority is to identify environmental, clinical and biological etiological factors, gain mechanistic insight into disease progression and use modern biological methods to identify measurement tools that could help in early risk stratification of pregnant women for preterm birth (and fetal growth restriction) in a large hospital-based cohort of pregnant women at a district hospital in Haryana. Such assessment tools based on a multi-disciplinary approach comprising methodologies of clinical, epidemiological, statistical, genetic, proteomic and imaging sciences will help in early identification of those “at risk” enabling early implementation of health and medical management tools to avoid mortality and adverse prognosis in later life. Her group has established a large bio bank of longitudinally collected varied bio specimens of these pregnant women with well characterized information on environmental, clinical, social and epidemiological determinants at different time points in pregnancy. This data will serve as an important national resource for answering additional research questions as new hypotheses emerge around birth, maternal health during pregnancy and questions around fetal origin of adult disease (Am J Epidemiol 2019).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trained as a paediatrician and after practicing for a few years,transitioned to become a physicianscientist.I have been doing clinical research for more than a decade and lead my research programme at THSTI. In my initial years as a researcher at AIIMS-New Delhi, I was involved with the conduct of hypothesis driven studies that evaluated interventions directed at several commonly occurring infections in children in India. I was groomed in the skills required for conducting rigorous and meaningful research. In 2010, I joined Translational Health Science and Technology Institute as a physician-scientist.I have been associated with several large multi-centre clinical trials using zinc for treatment of various childhood illnesses, surveillance for H-influenzae B in tertiary hospitals, establishing a large cohort of pregnant women to find solutions for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and observational studies to understand the development and maturation of the neonatal immune system. My  primary  research&lt;br /&gt;
interest is finding solutions for neonatal and early life morbidity and mortality.I am the PI for a large multi-country  multi-centre  clinical  trial  to  measure  the efficacy  of  adjunct  zinc  for  the  treatmen of young infant  sepsis  and  co-PI  on  another  large multi-country multi-site clinical trial to test the efficacy of
immediate continuous KMC in reducing neonatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been instrumentalin establishing a large longitudinal cohort of pregnant women for risk stratification of the women with adverse outcomes and am overseeing the conduct including the data management of the cohort. I have demonstrated my ability to establish, maintain and follow population and hospital cohorts with high quality data. My core expertise lies in design, conduct and analysis of hypothesis driven multicentre hospital based clinical studies. I have the competence to build and lead
multisite, multidisciplinary research teams that are capable of performing research to the most exacting standards of good clinical and ethical practices and to use risk and decision science for clinical medicine and public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have authored many publications including one in Lancet and have co-authored chapters in text books. I have been credited with the development of revised Consensus guidelines for the management and treatment of diarrhoea in children for NRHM (2006 &amp;amp; 2007)as member of National Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) and Management of Severe Acute Malnutrition (2006).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data Management Centre (DMC): Instrumental in establishing the data management centre (DMC) at the Paediatric Biology Centre (PBC) of THSTI and lead the data management for all clinical studies being conducted and coordinated by PBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported in establishing the Institutional Ethics Committee for Human Research at THSTI and in the registration of the IEC with CDSCO. Was a member secretary for the THSTI IEC for the first few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching: Coordinate the coursework on ‘Quantitative Methods in Research’ and ‘Clinical Trials’ for PhD students at THSTI. I am also a faculty for CDSA conducted workshops on Good Clinical Practice and Ethics in Biomedical Research&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical Operations at Clinical Development Services Agency (CDSA): Since 2017, I have an additional responsibility of CDSA operations. In this short span, CDSA has been awarded one collaborative grant with multiple interdisciplinary institutions and a consultancy for clinical trial regulatory and data safety advise. I am also a part of a number of key efforts (clinical trials toolkit, integrated electronic research
application platform, online e-courses) to enhance the Indian clinical research ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

pallavi.kshetrapal.thsti.res.in
MSc. Genetics, South Campus, Delhi University
Ph.D., Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad
Post-doctoral fellow Harvard Medical School, Boston. USA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Pallavi Kshetrapal is a molecular geneticist who obtained her PhD degree from Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and post-doctoral research training from Harvard Medical School Boston, USA. The focus of her lab is to study molecular pathways that are clinically relevant in adverse pregnancy. Using a range of different “omics’ approaches, studies that are described below, the lab is focused towards identification of biomarkers from human circulating blood and from human placenta that can be utilised for development of translational modalities against adverse pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biomarker discovery for prediction of pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pallavi Kshetrapal’s lab is currently involved in identification and validation of biomarkers circulating in maternal bodily fluids associated to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The methodology involved utilises  agnostic multi-pronged “omics” approach. Identified molecular signatures would then be validated and developed as potential biomarker/s for determination of risk assessment in a pregnant mothers. A classification algorithm based on various clinical and molecular determinant/s from mutltivariate data generated in a longitudinal cohort study may lead to generation of better models of risk stratification for assisting clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand the cellular and biochemical pathways functioning in the human placenta for maintaining a healthy pregnancy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placenta is a feto-maternal organ and is known to govern the outcome of pregnancy. In another ongoing study her lab intends to emphasize the use of circulating placenta-specific extracellular vesicles for diagnosing the adverse pregnancy outcome. These vesicles are being studied to identify the enveloped cargo capable of transducing signals from and to the fetus for healthy growth and development. Dr. Pallavi Kshetrapal’s lab is interested in identification and validation of placenta-specific markers in maternal circulation in normal and complicated pregnancies. They plan to use in vitroapproaches to highlight the putative utility of such tissue-specific extracellular vesicles (e.g. exosomes) in the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes and for treatment monitoring by studying the change in the placental function as the pregnancy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the physiological processes of self-nonself discrimination in terms of physicochemical principles of molecular interactions has been a major focus of our research. Our work on the pluripotency of primary immune response led to discovering new ways of antibody degeneracy and has impacted the evolving paradigm shift in immune recognition and generation of antibody repertoire [Immunity (2006) 24:359]. We have analyzed how immune system reacts when encountered with the antigens that keep changing shape and showed that the restricted paratope conformational repertoire on binding of an antigen to multiple independent antibodies may be relevant for minimizing possibility of selfreactive antibodies. Molecular insights into the functional mimicry in the context of immune response were addressed using structural, immunological and thermodynamic approaches. We have demonstrated how paratope plasticity facilitates molecular mimicry of otherwise unrelated antigens. While our analyses of carbohydrate-peptide mimicry provided important conceptual leads towards design and development of new generation of vaccines, the analyses involving carbohydrate-porphyrin mimicry provided possible mechanistic understanding of the molecular pathology of porphyria. Structural issues pertaining to innate immunity and food allergies are also being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;biography&#34;&gt;Biography&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have undertaken my doctoral research on genomic diversity of HIV-1 in India in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Subsequently, I have been engaged as Technical Support Scientist in Applied Biosystems as a member of European Task Forces on high throughput sequencing, gene expression, genotyping and forensic DNA analysis. Subsequently, I have also been Group Leader of Genomics in The Centre for Genomic Application (TCGA), New Delhi and Head of Functional Genomics in Thrombosis Research Institute, Bengaluru. Presently, I am an Associate Professor in National Institute of Biomedical Genomics. I am also the Coordinator of Core Technologies Research Initiative of NIBMG, Project Coordinator of the International Cancer Genome Consortium – India Project at NIBMG, Adjunct Faculty of Regional Centre for Biotechnology and Guest Lecturer of Department of Biochemistry, University of Calcutta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-interest&#34;&gt;Research Interest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research mission is to harness genomics to uncover important and novel information on human health and disease. The emergence of techniques like massively parallel DNA sequencing methods (MPS) has revolutionized our ability to identify causal genomic variants in various human health conditions. Exome and whole genome sequencing based approaches have already been shown to be successful in uncovering the genetic basis of multiple diseases. My aim is to harness emerging technologies like MPS to identify the genetic basis of causality of diseases with special emphasis on preterm birth and cancer. The ultimate purpose of undertaking such work is to discover important genetic information which can be used to identify actionable targets to improve human health.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Biography] :&lt;br /&gt;
I completed my Bachelors degree in Biochemistry from Daulat Ram College (Delhi University) in 1996. I was fortunate to get admission as an Integrated PhD (Biological Sciences) student at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I completed by PhD under the guidance of Dr. Sandhya S. Visweswariah at the Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics (MRDG). My PhD research work revolved around cGMP signaling pathways responsible for travellers’ diarrhea, specifically looking at the role of a Role of a cGMP binding-cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in regulating cGMP signaling. After completing my PhD, I joined Dr. Jan Christian’s laboratory at the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA. I was specifically looking at how differential cleavage of the morphogen Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (and its ortholog decapentaplegic in drosophila) regulates the ability of the protein to act as a long vs short range signaling molecule. My PhD and postdoctoral training was in cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the Pediatric Biology Center (PBC) at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) in September, 2010 as Scientist-D. At PBC, I was the only scientist from a basic biology background, with my other colleagues being clinical scientists. I was getting into research domains for which I had no prior experience. Discussions and collaborations with fellow clinicians opened a whole new world of human research to which I had never been exposed earlier. I started of with projects involving animal studies and cell culture based experiments and have since then come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Interests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the overall research theme of Maternal and Child Health my research focus is on childhood diseases and neonatal immune system maturation and activation under different stressors like low birth weight and conditions of probable serious bacterial infections (sepsis). Within the GARBH-Ini cohort I am interested in looking at the effect of infection and inflammation during the antenatal period on fetal growth and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and fetal growth :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy is a dynamic state where the balance of Th1 and Th2 immune responses changes along the different stages of pregnancy to maintain either a pro or anti-inflammatory status. Inflammation or infectious exposure during pregnancy can lead to disruption of this balance that can influence the growth of the fetus. An infant who is born small can have a modified immune system that responds differentially to subsequent infectious exposures leading to increased susceptibility to infectious morbidity.
We have started off by looking at the effects of antenatal inflammation on fetal growth and propose to extend this into looking at infants’ growth and development after birth.  The hypothesis is that “an exaggerated inflammatory response during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction”. This study is built in the ongoing pregnancy cohort and we propose to establish a birth cohort subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to address the issue of inflammation and fetal growth we will be profiling the pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines across normal pregnancy as there is no study to report on normative values for inflammatory status in Indian pregnant women. Considering the high pathogen load in our setting it is possible that the basal immune milieu during pregnancy is very different from that reported in the western world. In addition, we will also look at potential markers of fetal growth in maternal serum and associations between inflammation and fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research interests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immune cells in pregnancy are actively and specifically recruited to facilitate the  implantation of fetus in mother’s womb and promote a successful pregnancy.Several studies have been conducted by various research groups to identify the specific immunological patterns in pregnancy which are essential for a normal term birth of infant. An alteration in one or more of these components however, may lead to adverse outcomes of pregnancy such as IUGR, preterm birth and stillbirth.My current research interest is to conduct specific mechanistic studies to decipher the immunological patterns related to feto-maternal tolerance in predicting adverse of pregnancy and use of nutraceuticals to boost the feto-maternal tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in conducting the immunological and metabolite profiling of biological samples from the Garbhini cohort to understand the biology of stillbirth cases utilizing the transcriptome, metabolome and microbiome approaches.Specific mechanistic studies based on above would lead us to understand the role of nutraceuticals to avoid/reduce the cases of still birth in India.&lt;/p&gt;
