&lt;p&gt;Garbh-ini (Interdisciplinary Group for Advanced Research on Birth Outcomes—DBT India Initiative) was initiated by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), in 2014 as a collaborative interdisciplinary program. This program is led by Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), NCR Biotech cluster, Faridabad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garbh-Ini is a cohort study of pregnant women initiated in May 2015 at the civil hospital in Gurugram, Haryana, India. Women are enrolled within 20 weeks of gestation and are followed until delivery and once postpartum. The objectives are to identify clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and microbial correlates; discover molecular-risk markers by using an integrative -omics approach; and generate a risk-prediction algorithm for preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Biography  and Research    Interests] :
I trained as a paediatrician and after practicing for a few years,transitioned to become a physicianscientist.I have been doing clinical research for more than a decade and lead my research programme at THSTI. In my initial years as a researcher at AIIMS-New Delhi, I was involved with the conduct of hypothesis driven studies that evaluated interventions directed at several commonly occurring infections in children in India. I was groomed in the skills required for conducting rigorous and meaningful research. In 2010, I joined Translational Health Science and Technology Institute as a physician-scientist.I have been associated with several large multi-centre clinical trials using zinc for treatment of various childhood illnesses, surveillance for H-influenzae B in tertiary hospitals, establishing a large cohort of pregnant women to find solutions for adverse pregnancy outcomes, and observational studies to understand the development and maturation of the neonatal immune system. My  primary  research&lt;br /&gt;
interest is finding solutions for neonatal and early life morbidity and mortality.I am the PI for a large multi-country  multi-centre  clinical  trial  to  measure  the efficacy  of  adjunct  zinc  for  the  treatmen of young infant  sepsis  and  co-PI  on  another  large multi-country multi-site clinical trial to test the efficacy of
immediate continuous KMC in reducing neonatal mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been instrumentalin establishing a large longitudinal cohort of pregnant women for risk stratification of the women with adverse outcomes and am overseeing the conduct including the data management of the cohort.

&lt;p&gt;Dr Pallavi Kshetrapal is a molecular geneticist who obtained her PhD degree from Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and post-doctoral research training from Harvard Medical School Boston, USA. The focus of her lab is to study molecular pathways that are clinically relevant in adverse pregnancy. Using a range of different “omics’ approaches, studies that are described below, the lab is focused towards identification of biomarkers from human circulating blood and from human placenta that can be utilised for development of translational modalities against adverse pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biomarker discovery for prediction of pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pallavi Kshetrapal’s lab is currently involved in identification and validation of biomarkers circulating in maternal bodily fluids associated to adverse pregnancy outcomes. The methodology involved utilises  agnostic multi-pronged “omics” approach. Identified molecular signatures would then be validated and developed as potential biomarker/s for determination of risk assessment in a pregnant mothers. A classification algorithm based on various clinical and molecular determinant/s from mutltivariate data generated in a longitudinal cohort study may lead to generation of better models of risk stratification for assisting clinical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand the cellular and biochemical pathways functioning in the human placenta for maintaining a healthy pregnancy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Placenta is a feto-maternal organ and is known to govern the outcome of pregnancy. In another ongoing study her lab intends to emphasize the use of circulating placenta-specific extracellular vesicles for diagnosing the adverse pregnancy outcome. These vesicles are being studied to identify the enveloped cargo capable of transducing signals from and to the fetus for healthy growth and development. Dr. Pallavi Kshetrapal’s lab is interested in identification and validation of placenta-specific markers in maternal circulation in normal and complicated pregnancies. They plan to use in vitroapproaches to highlight the putative utility of such tissue-specific extracellular vesicles (e.g. exosomes) in the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes and for treatment monitoring by studying the change in the placental function as the pregnancy progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientific Activity :&lt;br /&gt;
                      Understanding the physiological processes of self-nonself discrimination in terms of physicochemical principles of molecular interactions has been a major focus of our research. Our work on the pluripotency of primary immune response led to discovering new ways of antibody degeneracy and has impacted the evolving paradigm shift in immune recognition and generation of antibody repertoire [Immunity (2006) 24:359]. We have analyzed how immune system reacts when encountered with the antigens that keep changing shape and showed that the restricted paratope conformational repertoire on binding of an antigen to multiple independent antibodies may be relevant for minimizing possibility of selfreactive antibodies. Molecular insights into the functional mimicry in the context of immune response were addressed using structural, immunological and thermodynamic approaches. We have demonstrated how paratope plasticity facilitates molecular mimicry of otherwise unrelated antigens. While our analyses of carbohydrate-peptide mimicry provided important conceptual leads towards design and development of new generation of vaccines, the analyses involving carbohydrate-porphyrin mimicry provided possible mechanistic understanding of the molecular pathology of porphyria. Structural issues pertaining to innate immunity and food allergies are also being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Genomics and Global Health Report 2004” has identified genomics as “the powerful new wave of health-related life sciences” with tremendous potential to address unresolved health problems, especially in the developing countries. My research mission is to rise to this challenge by harnessing emerging genomics technologies to uncover important and novel information on human health and disease. The emergence of techniques like massively parallel DNA sequencing methods (MPS) has revolutionized our ability to identify causal genomic variants in various human health conditions. Exome and whole genome sequencing based approaches have already been shown to be successful in uncovering the genetic basis of multiple diseases. My aim is to harness emerging technologies like MPS to identify the genetic basis of causality of diseases with special emphasis on maternal and infant health (preterm birth) and cancer. The ultimate purpose of undertaking such work is to discover important genetic information which can be translated into the identification of actionable targets to reduce the public health burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in the emanation of scientific knowledge for capacity building in research, in building a partnership with the industry and in engaging with the community at large. Hence, my activities and future plans are geared toward the realization of these goals. I actively participate in the teaching activities and workshops that are hosted for students and clinicians. I also participate in various programs with the industry and in the community programs undertaken by the institute to engage with the general population on biomedical genomics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub study
Stress outcomes on pregnancy and fetal growth: Development of methods to identify mothers at risk of preterm birth and intrauterine growth restriction resulting from maternal stress&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Arindam Maitra (NIBMG) Nitya Wadhwa (THSTI) &amp;amp; Tushar K. Maiti (RCB)
The goals of our study are to contribute to the understanding of the causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes and to find handles to ameliorate these outcomes. In particular, we shall test the hypothesis that sustained stress during pregnancy is a major contributor to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Our objective is to identify biological markers of stress during pregnancy that correlate with enhanced risk of adverse outcomes in mothers and their babies. Once identified, such at-risk mothers can be subjected to specific antenatal stress control programs aimed to eliminate or reduce stress during pregnancy. We are measuring stress by a cross-culturally validated psychological instrument (A-Z Score) and biologically by assaying for telomere length, DNA methylation alterations, levels of hair shaft cortisol and by proteomic analysis in mothers at two time points during pregnancy. This study has been funded by the Grand Challenge India – All Children Thriving Program.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Biography] :&lt;br /&gt;
I completed my Bachelors degree in Biochemistry from Daulat Ram College (Delhi University) in 1996. I was fortunate to get admission as an Integrated PhD (Biological Sciences) student at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I completed by PhD under the guidance of Dr. Sandhya S. Visweswariah at the Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics (MRDG). My PhD research work revolved around cGMP signaling pathways responsible for travellers’ diarrhea, specifically looking at the role of a Role of a cGMP binding-cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in regulating cGMP signaling. After completing my PhD, I joined Dr. Jan Christian’s laboratory at the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA. I was specifically looking at how differential cleavage of the morphogen Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (and its ortholog decapentaplegic in drosophila) regulates the ability of the protein to act as a long vs short range signaling molecule. My PhD and postdoctoral training was in cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the Pediatric Biology Center (PBC) at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) in September, 2010 as Scientist-D. At PBC, I was the only scientist from a basic biology background, with my other colleagues being clinical scientists. I was getting into research domains for which I had no prior experience. Discussions and collaborations with fellow clinicians opened a whole new world of human research to which I had never been exposed earlier. I started of with projects involving animal studies and cell culture based experiments and have since then come a long way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research Interests&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the overall research theme of Maternal and Child Health my research focus is on childhood diseases and neonatal immune system maturation and activation under different stressors like low birth weight and conditions of probable serious bacterial infections (sepsis). Within the GARBH-Ini cohort I am interested in looking at the effect of infection and inflammation during the antenatal period on fetal growth and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflammation and fetal growth :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy is a dynamic state where the balance of Th1 and Th2 immune responses changes along the different stages of pregnancy to maintain either a pro or anti-inflammatory status. Inflammation or infectious exposure during pregnancy can lead to disruption of this balance that can influence the growth of the fetus. An infant who is born small can have a modified immune system that responds differentially to subsequent infectious exposures leading to increased susceptibility to infectious morbidity.
We have started off by looking at the effects of antenatal inflammation on fetal growth and propose to extend this into looking at infants’ growth and development after birth.  The hypothesis is that “an exaggerated inflammatory response during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction”. This study is built in the ongoing pregnancy cohort and we propose to establish a birth cohort subsequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to address the issue of inflammation and fetal growth we will be profiling the pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines across normal pregnancy as there is no study to report on normative values for inflammatory status in Indian pregnant women. Considering the high pathogen load in our setting it is possible that the basal immune milieu during pregnancy is very different from that reported in the western world. In addition, we will also look at potential markers of fetal growth in maternal serum and associations between inflammation and fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research interests&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immune cells in pregnancy are actively and specifically recruited to facilitate the  implantation of fetus in mother’s womb and promote a successful pregnancy.Several studies have been conducted by various research groups to identify the specific immunological patterns in pregnancy which are essential for a normal term birth of infant. An alteration in one or more of these components however, may lead to adverse outcomes of pregnancy such as IUGR, preterm birth and stillbirth.My current research interest is to conduct specific mechanistic studies to decipher the immunological patterns related to feto-maternal tolerance in predicting adverse of pregnancy and use of nutraceuticals to boost the feto-maternal tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in conducting the immunological and metabolite profiling of biological samples from the Garbhini cohort to understand the biology of stillbirth cases utilizing the transcriptome, metabolome and microbiome approaches.Specific mechanistic studies based on above would lead us to understand the role of nutraceuticals to avoid/reduce the cases of still birth in India.&lt;/p&gt;
