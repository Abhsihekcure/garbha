She is a fellow of three national academies i.e FAMS, NAMS and INSA.\nResearch She moved to the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), NCR Biotech Science Cluster, Faridabad in 2010 and established the Pediatric Biology Centre (PBC), an interdisciplinary research center for conducting research on maternal and child health to inform clinical practice. She initiated a novel research program to create new insights in the neonatal and infant immune systems, its maturation over infancy, and how it responds to antenatal, perinatal and early childhood stressors (PlosONE 2015). She established a unique large multidisciplinary research programs that bridge classical epidemiology with modern science to find solutions for diseases that have major public health significance in the country. The current focus is preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. The priority is to identify environmental, clinical and biological etiological factors, gain mechanistic insight into disease progression and use modern biological methods to identify measurement tools that could help in early risk stratification of pregnant women for preterm birth (and fetal growth restriction) in a large hospital-based cohort of pregnant women at a district hospital in Haryana. Such assessment tools based on a multi-disciplinary approach comprising methodologies of clinical, epidemiological, statistical, genetic, proteomic and imaging sciences will help in early identification of those “at risk” enabling early implementation of health and medical management tools to avoid mortality and adverse prognosis in later life. Her group has established a large bio bank of longitudinally collected varied bio specimens of these pregnant women with well characterized information on environmental, clinical, social and epidemiological determinants at different time points in pregnancy. This data will serve as an important national resource for answering additional research questions as new hypotheses emerge around birth, maternal health during pregnancy and questions around fetal origin of adult disease (Am J Epidemiol 2019).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a2ba3eaff2345cb12cc47d54025a7b1c","permalink":"/authors/bhatnagar/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/bhatnagar/","section":"authors","summary":"Biography Prof. Shinjini Bhatnagar is a physician scientist who worked with the Dept. of pediatrics at AIIMS for 25 years as a pediatric gastroenterologist and as a research scientist.

I was fortunate to get admission as an Integrated PhD (Biological Sciences) student at Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I completed by PhD under the guidance of Dr. Sandhya S. Visweswariah at the Department of Molecular Reproduction, Development and Genetics (MRDG). My PhD research work revolved around cGMP signaling pathways responsible for travellers’ diarrhea, specifically looking at the role of a Role of a cGMP binding-cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE5) in regulating cGMP signaling. After completing my PhD, I joined Dr. Jan Christian’s laboratory at the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA. I was specifically looking at how differential cleavage of the morphogen Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (and its ortholog decapentaplegic in drosophila) regulates the ability of the protein to act as a long vs short range signaling molecule. My PhD and postdoctoral training was in cell biology, biochemistry and molecular biology.\nI joined the Pediatric Biology Center (PBC) at Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) in September, 2010 as Scientist-D. At PBC, I was the only scientist from a basic biology background, with my other colleagues being clinical scientists. I was getting into research domains for which I had no prior experience. Discussions and collaborations with fellow clinicians opened a whole new world of human research to which I had never been exposed earlier. I started of with projects involving animal studies and cell culture based experiments and have since then come a long way.\nResearch Interests\nUnder the overall research theme of Maternal and Child Health my research focus is on childhood diseases and neonatal immune system maturation and activation under different stressors like low birth weight and conditions of probable serious bacterial infections (sepsis). Within the GARBH-Ini cohort I am interested in looking at the effect of infection and inflammation during the antenatal period on fetal growth and preterm birth.\nInflammation and fetal growth :\nPregnancy is a dynamic state where the balance of Th1 and Th2 immune responses changes along the different stages of pregnancy to maintain either a pro or anti-inflammatory status. Inflammation or infectious exposure during pregnancy can lead to disruption of this balance that can influence the growth of the fetus. An infant who is born small can have a modified immune system that responds differentially to subsequent infectious exposures leading to increased susceptibility to infectious morbidity. We have started off by looking at the effects of antenatal inflammation on fetal growth and propose to extend this into looking at infants’ growth and development after birth. The hypothesis is that “an exaggerated inflammatory response during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction”. This study is built in the ongoing pregnancy cohort and we propose to establish a birth cohort subsequently.\nIn order to address the issue of inflammation and fetal growth we will be profiling the pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines across normal pregnancy as there is no study to report on normative values for inflammatory status in Indian pregnant women. Considering the high pathogen load in our setting it is possible that the basal immune milieu during pregnancy is very different from that reported in the western world. In addition, we will also look at potential markers of fetal growth in maternal serum and associations between inflammation and fetal growth restriction and preterm birth.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b88b95cf2beb76e358dc18259d62b8eb","permalink":"/authors/fshailaja/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/fshailaja/","section":"authors","summary":"[Biography] :\nI completed my Bachelors degree in Biochemistry from Daulat Ram College (Delhi University) in 1996.

An alteration in one or more of these components however, may lead to adverse outcomes of pregnancy such as IUGR, preterm birth and stillbirth.My current research interest is to conduct specific mechanistic studies to decipher the immunological patterns related to feto-maternal tolerance in predicting adverse of pregnancy and use of nutraceuticals to boost the feto-maternal tolerance.\nI am also interested in conducting the immunological and metabolite profiling of biological samples from the Garbhini cohort to understand the biology of stillbirth cases utilizing the transcriptome, metabolome and microbiome approaches.Specific mechanistic studies based on above would lead us to understand the role of nutraceuticals to avoid/reduce the cases of still birth in India.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c94542265e56ead43bd9052abb871970","permalink":"/authors/gruchi/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/gruchi/","section":"authors","summary":"[biography] : Cutting edge expertise in drug discovery area with a detailed understanding of disease biology utilizing basic science as well as applied biochemistry,cell \u0026amp; molecularbiology and organic chemistry.
