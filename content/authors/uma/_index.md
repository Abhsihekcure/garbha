Under the auspices of the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), the Interdisciplinary Group for Advanced Research on Birth Outcomesâ€”DBT India Initiative (GARBH-Ini) study was initiated by the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Delhi National Capital Region, in 2014 as a collaborative interdisciplinary program.

Garbh-Ini is a cohort study of pregnant women initiated in May 2015 at the civil hospital in Gurugram, Haryana, India. Women are enrolled within 20 weeks of gestation and are followed until delivery and once postpartum. The objectives are to identify clinical, epidemiologic, genomic, epigenomic, proteomic, and microbial correlates; discover molecular-risk markers by using an integrative -omics approach; and generate a risk-prediction algorithm for preterm birth.
