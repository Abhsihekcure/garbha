Research Interests

Human Genome Variation :
                                   There is considerable variation among genomes of individuals, who are often clustered in social groups in geographically proximal regions.  I am interested in the study of such variation to draw inferences on human evolution, population structure, susceptibilities to diseases, responses to drugs and vaccines, etc.

 

Statistical Genomics :
                             I am interested in statistical applications and in developing methodologies for drawing statistically valid inferences from genomic data.
