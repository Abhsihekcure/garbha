Research Interest

Human Genome Variation: I am interested in reconstruction of human movements using genomic data, inferring genetic structures of population groups and admixtures among them, and using these inferences to understand genetic epijdemiolgy of disease.
Statistical Genomics: I am interested in developing statistical methodologies and applying statistical methods in genetics.
Genetics and Genomics of Disease:  I am interested in drawing inferences on genetic bases of human diseases and adverse life events using data on families, relative pairs and unrelated individuals.  My current focus is on cancer and pre-term birth.
