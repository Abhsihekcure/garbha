# Innovative solutions for maternal and child health using medical image analysis and Artificial Intelligence

### Background 
Maternal and child health is a key indicator of the health of a society particularly in low-middle income countries. A major challenge is the lack of cutting edge applications for  prevention and early diagnosis of diseases that have public health implications. One way forward is to use the recent advances in medical image analysis for addressing these issues. Machine learning, especially deep learning, is an innovative method to  identify, classify, and quantify patterns in medical images that can be used to develop  relevant tools for clinical and public health applications. Additionally, these tools can provide understanding of underlying biological mechanisms. Interdisciplinary groups working in synergy would further augment this initiative. This workshop on “Innovative solutions for maternal and child  health using medical image analysis and AI” will bring together  clinicians, physician-scientists, biologists, computer vision scientists and young researchers together on a common platform to initiate thought-provoking discussions and identify some important research questions that can form the basis of innovative solutions . 
### Aim 
The main aim of the workshop is to discuss the scope of medical image analysis for augmenting research to find innovative solutions in Maternal and Child Health
### Objectives
   1. Identify research questions emerging from clinical and public health need for low- middle income countries which can be addressed by image processing and AI. 
   2. Provide deeper understanding of image processing tools that would facilitate research .  
   3. Hands-on-training /attempt to address one of the research questions identified.
### Program 
This is envisioned as a two-day workshop and is divided into 4 major sessions comprised of keynote address, research question driven seminars, presentations and panel discussions. 
<br />
The first session on the day 1 focuses on identifying research questions where image-based analytics could be a solution for both clinical needs and biological questions (Diagnosic, Assistive, Predictive). The second session will highlight existing and potential novel approaches of evidence generation to translate technological solutions to the clinic; discuss limitations. Day 2 will focus on the methods to develop various image-based technologies that can be used to solve healthcare problems including advantages and limitations of each. A dedicated session on hands-on problem solving using a real-world image dataset to answer one of the questions identified during the workshop will be held.

### Outcomes
   1. Identify key research questions that can be addressed by image analysis and AI in the domain of maternal and child health.  
   2. Develop interdisciplinary collaborations.
   3. Hands-on knowledge of the clinical issues, the image processing toolkit and translational approaches for the participants
   4. A publication of the discussion on the key clinical and biological issues, challenges and novel opportunities using image analysis.
